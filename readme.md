#Leboncoin scrapper (another one)
This is a basic leboncoin scrapper that I use to collect some data about
renting prices in Paris.


Honestly, you shouldn't even consider using that piece of code… I leave it here
just in case it will help somebody (even if it is very unlikely).


Since this code is verrrrrry generic: it will work only with apartments-related
stuff.

#Howisworking?

That's kind of simple:

0. Setup your database tables by running initdb.py
1. Set a url to scrap according to your filters (you can just pick it up from your browser.)
2. Hardcode it in scraper.py (told you, this code is a masterpiece of engineering).
3. Run scraper.py.

#Troubleshooting

WOW, something is broken? Well, that's too bad, I will not maintain that shit… Sorry…
